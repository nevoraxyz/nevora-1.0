## Why This Matters
In today’s digital world, health data is one of the most sensitive types of information, yet it is frequently collected, shared, and at risk of misuse. Your wellbeing should not be a commodity — it should be something you fully control.

Nevora solves this by recording your wellness progress through **encrypted, verifiable signals** that cannot be altered or manipulated, ensuring that every record remains authentic, trustworthy, and private.

With this secure foundation, you can use your health data in real time or share it confidentially with medical professionals, without exposing any underlying details to anyone else.

## The Vision
Nevora aims to become the **first blockchain-connected health platform** that protects user privacy, prevents data manipulation, and empowers modern wellbeing through secure, self-owned health identities.
